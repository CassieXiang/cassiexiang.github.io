## Working Paper
**Educational Decisions in the Shadow of Cronyism: An Empirical Study of College Graduates in China**, with *Xiaofan Zhu*.
<br>
**Abstract:** This paper investigates how inefficient political institutions, marked by rampant corruption and cronyism, shape students' educational choices based on their political connections. Utilizing the recent anti-corruption campaign in China, we find that college graduates with cadre parents from more corrupt regions are more likely to pursue further studies after the campaign. The effects are more pronounced among students with a non-STEM major, lower academic performance, and more powerful political connections, and among males. The study of underlying mechanisms suggests a more equitable post-campaign employment environment, where connected students need stronger educational qualifications to remain competitive against their unconnected counterparts. <br>

**Gender Gap, Structural Change and Female Comparative Advantage**, with [*Marc Dordal i Carreras*](https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarcdordal.github.io%2F&data=05%7C02%7Ccxiang%40connect.ust.hk%7Cf0b9281d060842169e0108dda71b5d66%7C6c1d415239d044ca88d9b8d6ddca0708%7C1%7C0%7C638850458173818548%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=NIHs7Z5tA6utbX9rWOScs%2BZLXc6VkSEFzMyEOKRYzuU%3D&reserved=0) <br>
**Abstract:** This paper examines the decline in female labor force participation (LFP) in developing countries by linking structural change to female comparative advantage (CA). Our model predicts that female LFP decreases when women's CA is concentrated in contracting sectors and increases when it shifts to expanding sectors. In many developing economies, the CA often resides in the shrinking agricultural sector. We validate the framework using Chinese census data, demonstrating its ability to explain regional female LFP variations and gender gaps in LFP, and further apply it to India to illustrate its broader predictive utility. <br>

**The Effect of On-campus Student Accommodation on Academic and Non-academic Outcomes,** 
with *Xuanyi Jin, Sujata Visaria, and Xiaofan Zhu*
<br>
**Abstract:** This study examines the impact of on-campus residence halls on academic and job market outcomes, as well as subjective wellbeing among students at a first-tier university in Hong Kong. Leveraging administrative data and a random allocation system, we find that students residing in halls exhibit lower yearly Grade Point Averages, receive fewer job offers upon graduation, and report higher satisfaction with their hall experience. Across the complete sample of students analyzed, male students are particularly influenced by hall residency. We further study the underlying mechanisms and identify that underutilization of school learning facilities and fewer full-time internships of hall residents may contribute to the observed academic and labor market performance differences. Our research contributes to understanding the role of college amenities in human capital accumulation and sheds light on gender-specific effects of on-campus residence. <br>
